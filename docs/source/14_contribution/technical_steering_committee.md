# Join the Technical Steering Committee

A group of maintainers on the Kedro project is known as the Technical Steering Committee (TSC). The TSC has many responsibilities surrounding the project's future development; you can read about our duties in our Technical Charter. We accept new members on the TSC as this fuels Kedro's continued development. You can see [a list of Kedro's current and past maintainers](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/12_faq/01_faq.html#who-maintains-kedro).

In this section, we detail:
 * [Responsibilities of a maintainer](#responsibilities-of-a-maintainer)
 * [Requirements to become a maintainer](#requirements-to-become-a-maintainer)
 * [Application process](#application-process)
 * [Removing a maintainer](#removing-a-maintainer)


## Responsibilities of a maintainer

| Community management | * Make sure that ongoing pull requests are moving forward at the right pace or closing them<br>* Guide the community to use the right channel: [Github](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/) for feature requests and bug reports, [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/discussions) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/akJDeVaxnB). |


## Requirements to become a maintainer

Just contributing does not make you a maintainer; you need to demonstrate commitment to Kedro's long-term success by
working with existing maintainers for a period.

We look for commitment markers with the following:

* Being able to write solid code and collaborate with the team and community
* Understanding the project's code base and internals
* Doing pull requests from our backlog or roadmap; maintainers need to work towards a common goal
* Learning how the team works, including processes for testing, quality standards and code review
* Evidence of already having started pull requests and code reviews under the guidance of maintainers; including asking
  for help where needed


## Application process

Quarterly, existing maintainers will curate a list of contributors that have shown regular activity on the project over the prior months. From this list, maintainer candidates are selected and proposed for a vote.

Following a successful vote, candidates are added to the `kedro-developers` team on the Kedro GitHub organisation
and the `kedro-team` group on the Kedro Discord organisation.

## Voting process

The TSC can vote on the addition and removal of maintainers as well as other issues that affect the future of the 
Kedro project. The voting period is one week and is either performed on GitHub Discussions or through a pull request.

### Other issues or proposals

The process of voting on issues, proposals and changes is performed by creating an open Github Discussion. Proposals affecting the future of Kedro or other changes require a simple majority. 

### Adding or removing maintainers

The process of adding or removing maintainers is done via composing a pull request against [our team list](.. /12_faq/01_faq.md#who-maintains-kedro). The decision is made based on TSC members votes in that pull request. If a member of the TSC is removed as voting maintainer than they can volunteer for non-voting Contributor or Friends status. Additions and removals of maintainers require a 2/3 majority.
